TICA:
The TICA paper has a lot of interformation that is not directly relevant to the algorithm.
The core information will be found on page 7.

kMeans:
should be self-explanatory.

HMM:
You will need:
- the forward-backward algorithm (p. 6)
- the maximum likelihood estimates for the paramters (p. 9)
The Viterbi algorithm and other features might be needed later (for analyzing the result),
but are not needed for the estimation.


General Remarks:
- Especially for TICA and kMeans: Think about what happens if the input coordinates are too large to fit main memory.
- We will also need to worry about input and output, but let's focus on the algorithms first.

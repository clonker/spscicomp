# instructions to generate data for a toy model (for testing)

1) Define a transition matrix P (metastable, i.e. should have elements close to 1 on the diagonal)
2) Generate a discrete trajectory (Markov chain) s(t) using P
3) Define an output probability distribution for each state i of P, e.g. a Gaussian with mean mu_i
   and covariance matrix C_i
4) For each time t, generate an output x(t) ~ G(mu_s(t), C_s(t))
5) Define a rotation matrix and translation vector to rotate the low-dimensional x(t) into a high-
   dimensional space Omega. We get X(t)
6) Add Gaussian noise to all dimensions of Omega


Reconstruction:
I) Use TICA to find the relevant subspace of slow processes (should essentially invert the rotation
   matrix above)
II) Use k-means to discretize the data (must separate the two Gaussian distributions in order to
    work well)
III) Use HMM with 2 hidden states. You should be able to recover the transition matrix
